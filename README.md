## Description

Airbnb frontend clone was created from scratch with data created from sanity io as a backend with different schemas. In the backend you can add details about the property like: location, description, multiple images, reviews and the hosts of each property. The frontend was built with Next to fetch data from sanity to render it to the client side.

- You can go through the backend data and see the schemas created.
